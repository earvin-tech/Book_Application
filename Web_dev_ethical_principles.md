# Ethical Principles

1. Accessability

We want to make sure that this application is accessible to everyone. Some common feature we will implement will include: 
   - Alternative text for images or visuals. This allows people to understand what is meant to be shown in case an image or visual aid does not load properly on the web-page for any reason
   - We will ensure the application is keyboard friendly but also touch screen friendly: we want as many devices as possible able to use our app, the exception perhaps only smart watches or any with very small screen.
   - It would be great to allow a large number of users to test the features however this is a very small scale project it will not have as much resources to allow for such a large number of user testing.
   - We will strive to make forms inclusive taking into account all user needs for the UI.
  
2. Responsivity

We will strive to make the application responsive to as many device types as possible.
   - We will be following the bootstrap

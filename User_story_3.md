### **User feed/Activity stream**

**User Story:** As a reader who likes to discuss books with friends, I would like to be able to see what my friends are reading and recommending, as well as what they rate their books. This would allow me to seek other options of books and know what my friends are interested in too.

- **Need/Justification:** To fulfil the social aspect of this app, allowing users to see their friends activity is a must-have feature.

- **Want/Feature/Function:** Users should be able to see recommended books from friends and rating of books.

- **Development Translation:**  We use the engine developed to analyze a userâ€™s reading history, ratings, and preferences to suggest books. However we now make it public for the user's friends so that recommendations come through a feed. We also allow friends data to be seen by the user. This data will all be requested from the server. It will be displayed to the client randomized to similar to other social media feeds.

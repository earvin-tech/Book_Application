## **User Story Example**

Let's outline clear user stories for four unique features in order to properly develop the book app that has been outlined. These functionalities include the following: Account Creation and Authentication and Book Rating System. Each user narrative will comprise the need or reason, the want or feature or function, and an explanation of how these elements translate into requirements for program development.

### **Account Creation and Authentication**

**User Story:** As a new user, I would like to be able to simply create an account by using my email address, social media, or a username and password. This would allow me to access my personalized reading environment in a secure manner.

- **Need/Justification:** When it comes to user adoption and confidence, security and simplicity of access are extremely important factors. In order to respond to the preferences of users and improve accessibility, providing different sign-up alternatives is essential.

- **Want/Feature/Function:** It should be possible for users to sign up for the app and log in using their email addresses, social media accounts, or a username that is accompanied by a password.

- **Development Translation:**  The use of OAuth for social media integrations, a secure email verification mechanism, and encrypted password storage are all desirable features. Create an authentication module for users that can accommodate a variety of different login methods.

### **Book Rating System**

**User Story:** Being a bookworm, I want to evaluate books I have read using a 1-5 rating system and give reviews so I may share my thoughts with the community and impact book suggestions.

- **Need/Justification:** Users are able to browse and express their thoughts on books through rating systems, which helps to cultivate a community of readers and provides assistance with decision-making capabilities.

- **Want/Feature/Function:** In addition to being able to post written reviews, users are also able to evaluate books on a scale ranging from one to five stars.

- **Development Translation:** Create a database schema that includes user IDs, book IDs, ratings, and reviews. Implement front-end components for users to submit ratings and reviews and backend logic to calculate average ratings and display reviews.

## **Introduction**
This research investigates how Agile and Scrum techniques, along with Trello for task management, were used in the creation of a book application. Account setup, book rating, reading progress monitoring, suggestions, and social interactions are some of the app's features.

### **Agile Methodology**

Agile is a project management approach that focuses on flexibility, ongoing improvement, and producing high-quality results. It consists of breaking projects down into brief periods of work and often reassessing and adapting strategies. This procedure is repeated to guarantee that the product satisfies the expectations of its consumers and can adjust to new demands as they arise.

The following are some important practices of Agile:

-	Sprints: These are brief, well-defined cycles (often lasting one to two weeks) that focus on the development of features of the application.
-	User Stories: Each feature of the software is broken down into small, doable tasks that can be done in a single sprint cycle.
-	Daily Stand-ups: These are short meetings that take place every day, during which team members share updates on their progress and discuss their future moves.
-	Retrospectives: These sessions take place at the end of each sprint to discuss what went well and to determine areas where improvements may be made.

### **Scrum Methodology**
Scrum is an Agile framework that organizes software development into cycles called Sprints, which typically run between two and four weeks. At the beginning of each sprint, the team holds a planning meeting in which they select items from a backlog that they think they will be able to do within the sprint.

The following are the components of Scrum that are utilized:

-	Product Backlog: This is a set of project needs that have been prioritized and presented as user stories. For example, "As a user, I want to rate books so that I can influence the recommendations I receive."

-	Sprint Planning: This is the process of determining which features will be developed in the next sprint. For example, in Sprint 1, the authentication system will be put up.

-	Daily Scrum: These are short meetings that take place every day to talk about how things are doing and any problems that have come up.

-	Sprint Review: At the end of each sprint, the work that has been accomplished is shown to stakeholders so that they may provide their input.

-	Sprint Retrospective: This is a meeting that takes place at the conclusion of each sprint to reflect on what went well and what may be improved for the next sprint.

### **Task Management Tool: Trello**

Trello is a tool that helps you graphically organize and keep track of development activities by using a system of boards, lists, and cards.

This is the way Trello is set up:

-	Boards: These are created for various stages of the project, including Development, Testing, and Deployment.

-	Lists: These show the several stages of task completion, such as To Do, In Progress, Review, and Done, and illustrate how tasks are progressing.

-	Cards: These are individual tasks or user stories that are moved around the lists as they are being worked on and completed.
Scenario

The following is an example of how Sprint Planning and Trello may be used together in a project:

-	Sprint Planning: The team selects user stories from the Product Backlog, such as "Implement email authentication for account creation," and transfers them to the Sprint Backlog.

-	Trello Setup: Each user narrative that is picked is represented by a card, which is originally placed in the "To Do" column on our Trello board.

-	Daily Scrum: Each day, team members update the status of their cards, moving them to "In Progress," "Review," or "Done" as they complete their duties.

-	Sprint Review: At the end of the sprint, the team goes over the cards that have been finished to make sure that the work fulfills the acceptance criteria that were established.

-	Retrospective: The team talks about possible improvements for the upcoming sprint and adjusts the Trello lists and cards based on this feedback.

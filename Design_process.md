## Programming Paradigm - Object Oriented Programming
For this application we have opted to use Object Oriented Programming. Object oriented programming or OOP is a programming paradigm in which real world things are represented as objects in code. These objects consist of two things: attributes and methods. 

Using a real world example, let us represent a bank account. So a bank account's attributes would be what make a bank account, it needs to have an account number, balance, maybe an account type, like checking or savings. A method would be a process that this object, the bank account performs such as depositing, withdrawing, showing balance.

Example of bank account object.

In the above image it shows a bank account represented as an object. Without going into too much detail, it simply contains attributes such as account type, balance, and id. It's methods it can perform are deposit and withdraw. All actions a bank account performs in the real world are represented as an object in code.
